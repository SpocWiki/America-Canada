> The **Canada Act** 1982 (1982 c. 11) (French: Loi de 1982 sur le Canada) 
> is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom 
> and one of the enactments which make up the Constitution of Canada. 
> 
> It was enacted at the request of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada 
> to patriate Canada's constitution, ending the power of the British Parliament to amend the constitution. The act also formally ended the "request and consent" provisions of the Statute of Westminster 1931 
> in relation to Canada, 
> whereby the British parliament had a general power to pass laws extending to Canada at its own request.
>
> Annexed as Schedule B to the act is the text of the Constitution Act, 1982, 
> in both of Canada's official languages (i.e. English and French). 
> Because of the requirements of official bilingualism, 
> the body of the Canada Act itself is also set out in French in Schedule A to the act, 
> which is declared by s. 3 to have "the same authority in Canada as the English version thereof".
