> **Estrie** (French pronunciation: [ɛstʁi]) is an administrative region of Quebec that comprises the Eastern Townships. Estrie, a French neologism, was coined as a derivative of est, "east". Originally settled by anglophones, today it is about 90 per cent francophone. Anglophones are concentrated in Lennoxville, home of the region's only English-speaking university, Bishop's University. The English-language Eastern Townships School Board runs 20 elementary schools, three high schools, and a learning centre.
>
> The region originally consisted of 6 regional county municipalities. In 2021, La Haute-Yamaska & Brome-Missisquoi joined Estrie, transferring from Montérégie.
