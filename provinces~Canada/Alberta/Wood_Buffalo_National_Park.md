> Wood Buffalo National Park is the largest national park of Canada at 44,741 km2 (17,275 sq mi). 
> 
> It is in northeastern [[../Alberta|Alberta]] and the southern [[../Northwest_Territories|Northwest Territories]]. 
> Larger in area than Switzerland, it is the second-largest national park in the world. 
> The park was established in 1922 to protect the world's largest herd of free-roaming wood bison. 
> They became hybridized after the introduction of plains bison. 
> The population is currently estimated at 3,000. It is one of two known nesting sites of whooping cranes.
>
> The park ranges in elevation from 183 m (600 ft) at the Little Buffalo River to 945 m (3,100 ft) in the Caribou Mountains. The park headquarters is in Fort Smith, with a smaller satellite office in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta. The park contains one of the world's largest fresh-water deltas, the Peace-Athabasca Delta, formed by the Peace, Athabasca and Birch rivers.
>
> It is also known for its karst sinkholes in the north-eastern section of the park. Alberta's largest springs (by volume, with an estimated discharge rate of eight cubic metres per second), Neon Lake Springs, are in the Jackfish River drainage. Wood Buffalo is located directly north of the Athabasca Oil Sands.
>
> This area was designated in 1983 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for the biological diversity of the Peace-Athabasca Delta, and for the population of wild bison. It is the most ecologically complete and largest example of the Great Plains-Boreal grassland ecosystem of North America.
>
> On June 28, 2013, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada designated Wood Buffalo National Park as Canada's newest and the world's largest dark-sky preserve. The designation helps preserve nighttime ecology for the park's large populations of bats, night hawks and owls, as well as providing opportunities for visitors to experience the northern lights.
