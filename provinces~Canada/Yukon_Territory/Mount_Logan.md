> Mount Logan ( LOH-ghən) is the highest mountain in Canada 
> and the second-highest peak in North America after Denali (McKinley). 
> 
> The mountain was named after Sir William Edmond Logan, 
> a Canadian geologist and founder of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). 
> 
> Mount Logan is located within Kluane National Park and Reserve in southwestern Yukon, 
> less than 40 km (25 mi) north of the Yukon–Alaska border. 
> 
> Mount Logan is the source of the Hubbard and Logan glaciers. 
> Although many shield volcanoes are much larger in size and mass, 
> Mount Logan is believed to have the largest base circumference 
> of any non-volcanic mountain on Earth, 
> including a massif with eleven peaks over 5,000 m (16,000 ft). 
> Mount Logan is the 6th most topographically prominent peak on Earth.
>
> Due to active tectonic uplifting, Mount Logan is still rising in height 
> (approximately 0.35 mm (0.014 in) per year). 
> Before 1992, the exact elevation of Mount Logan was unknown 
> and measurements ranged from 5,959 to 6,050 m (19,551 to 19,849 ft). 
> In May 1992, a GSC expedition climbed Mount Logan 
> and fixed the current height of 5,959 m (19,551 ft) using GPS.
>
> Temperatures are extremely low on and near Mount Logan. 
> On the 5,000 m plateau, air temperature hovers around −45 °C (−49 °F) in the winter 
> and reaches near freezing in summer with the median temperature for the year around −27 °C (−17 °F). 
> 
> Minimal snow melt leads to a significant ice cap, almost 300 m (980 ft) thick in certain spots.
