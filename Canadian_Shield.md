> The Canadian Shield (French: Bouclier canadien [buklje kanadjɛ̃]), 
> also called the Laurentian Shield or the  Laurentian Plateau, is a geologic shield, 
> a large area of exposed Precambrian igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks. 
> 
> It forms the North American Craton (or Laurentia), the ancient geologic core of the North American continent. 
> Glaciation has left the area with only a thin layer of soil, 
> through which exposures of igneous bedrock 
> resulting from its long volcanic history are frequently visible. 
> 
> As a deep, common, joined bedrock region in eastern and central Canada, 
> the shield stretches north from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, 
> covering over half of Canada and most of Greenland; 
> it also extends south into the northern reaches of the continental United States.
